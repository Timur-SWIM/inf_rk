Once upon, a time a very long time ago now, about last Friday,
Winnie-the-Pooh lived in a forest all by himself under the name of Sanders.
And in the middle of this place was a large oak-tree, and,
from the top of the tree, there came a loud buzzing-noise.
Winnie-the-Pooh sat down at the foot of the tree, put his head between his
paws and began to think.
